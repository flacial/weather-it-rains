# WeatherItRains
WeatherItRains is a weather app that displays the current day weather, along with the next 3 days and hourly weather of a location (also changes background images depending on weather conditions). I named it WeatherItRains because with this app, you will be prepared for the weather... whether it rains or not (I love puns if you couldn't tell).

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Description
This is a weather app that shows the next 3 day forecast of the location you search, and the hourly forecast for each day (for the current day it shows the next hour to 11PM). It also changes background image depending on what the weather conditions (ie sunny) are. The default location is San Jose, California, but enter a location to see other weather data! It's also responsive, so feel free to view the site on your other mobile devices/tablets.

### Motivation
As a next step in my coding journey, I learned about APIs, promises, async, and await. As someone who frequently checks the weather before going out or making plans, it seemed like a natural step to create this app. One of my favorite aspects of the app's functionality is being able to display hourly weather forecast for future days, and not just the current day. I often want to see the hourly forecast for upcoming days, not just today, so having hourly forecasts for the different forecasted days would let me know if I should pack a warmer jacket if I am staying out late the next day or later in the week when I have plans. 

Although I know creating a weather app is fairly typical of coders to make, what sets this apart, is that this weather app **IS NOT based on a tutorial**. I spent a lot of time thinking about how to approach pulling data from the API, organizing it, and of course the best way to structure and organize the code.

### Reflection
Wow, there were so many difficult parts about building this project. It's definitely been the longest and most difficult project that I have made so far with around 400 commits. And I ran into bugs every few seconds it seems, but ...I persevered. This project also made me realize why React is so useful; every time I had to create an element, append an element, or edit the DOM structure, there were multiple steps involved that became very repetitive. This was also the first time I used a development server (node.js live server) because trying to open index.html directly in the browser as a file caused a CORS error where the cross-origin request was blocked.

#### User Interface
Before beginning to code, I had to think about what information that I felt was important and relevant enough to display on the user-interface. I ended up designing the weather app to show the current day weather (because that is what most people will want to see first and is most relevant), a 3 day forecast (only 3 days, because after the free trial, you can only see a 3 day forecast), and hourly forecasts. At first, I thought that I would just display hourly forecast of the current day as that is what most weather apps do, but decided that it would be helpful to show hourly forecasts of every day in the 3 day forecast. Additionally, I added the functionality of being able to toggle from day and hourly forecasts using buttons. The hourly forecasts were in 8 hour intervals which made sense to me as a time frame that would be perfect length (also a workday). I also had to consider which hours to show in the hourly forecast, specifically for the current day. For example, the current day starts from the next hour from the current hour and not 12AM. This is because for the user, since the past hours have already passed and they are already living the current hour, they most likely wouldn't need to know the past/current hour temperatures. I also ended the hour intervals at 11PM for each day forecast, because even though the hours rolling over to the next day (ie today's forecast displaying up to 11PM, then 12AM etc of the next day) may be convenient, it is also a little confusing and misleading if pressing the hourly forecast button on the current day card included part of the next day's forecast. 


#### OOP and Classes VS Factory Functions
I did consider using factory functions or constructor functions instead of classes for this project. I know using composition in factory functions could have been easier, and perhaps more flexible/maintainable,  but since I had already used factory functions in my Tic-Tac-Toe project (https://github.com/yh63935/tic-tac-toe), I wanted to practice using classes especially since other languages such as Java do have classes.

When creating the classes and derived classes, I thought about SOLID OOP, specifically single responsibility, interface segregation, and open/closed principle. For the base class, I debated about putting different methods that wouldn't be used by all classes (but would certainly make my life easier haha), but I wanted to try my best to have each class only use the methods that it had instead of having unneccessary methods they wouldn't use. For different method functionality, I extended the class for the different weather cards from the base class.

#### API Data Organization
Another piece of the project that was deciding how to organize the data that the API would pull in. Instead of listing the properties manually like I have in the project, I thought about going through the data recursively to get properties because they have similar structures. However, since the dataset is so big and even the individual levels had quite a lot of properties, that didnâ€™t seem like a good idea in terms of both space and time complexity. I realized the best solution was not to store all the data, but just the ones that I needed and to simplify the paths that I would need to access them in a function (parseWeatherData). To do this, I made a new object containing the paths in the weather data API with simplified properties to access those paths.


#### Maintainability, Reusability, and Readability 

##### DOM Elements/HTML Strucutre
Another part of this project I had never considered deeply iswhat the HTML structure should be like (I revised it several times during the coding process), what elements should be in the DOM structure directly, and what elements should be rendered by Javascript. When coding, I thought about when to query elements directly from the DOM versus passing it in as a parameter. I ended up only querying elements directly from index.html in the index.js file, and when those elements were needed in other files, passing them in as a parameter instead. That's why in components.js the only query selector statements will be querying from the element that the function created (the card itself). This separation of concerns helped modularity, encapsulation, maintainability, and reusability. If I wanted those cards or elements within the card to be appended elsewhere, all I would have to do is pass in a different container for the parameter, without changing multiple DOM querySelector calls. It also separated what was already on the DOM originally, versus what was created by Javascript. 


##### Comments, Filenames, and Modules
Yet again, I was doubly hit with the importance of descriptive comments and variables. In the process of writing my code, there were often times where I was testing code out with variable or function names that had once reflected something else. This quickly got confusing to the point where I couldn't even explain to myself what my code was doing. I learned some ways to name variables and functions descriptively to represent what they returned or what they checked for. For example, instead of a variable imperialMetric for determining whether the imperial or metric system was selected, naming it instead to isImperial for clarity. File and folder names were also important as I separated utilities into different files for types of utilities when they were originally just clumped together into one file.


#### API Key
As you must have noticed by now, my API key in the code in my repository is not encrypted. For security reasons, I am aware that I shouldn't "trust the client", but since this API key is public, I am exposing it for now, since I have not yet learned on the back-end how to securely deal with this issue. 


#### Future Improvements/Possible Features
* Currently doesn't check country/coordinates for exact location
  * ie san jose could be San Jose, CA or San Jose, Costa Rica
* Adding different icons that reflect the moon phase of the day would be cute
* Adding a character with an outfit depending on the temperature/weather conditions
  * I think this would be really cool for the future, ie if you click on display outfit, it will display a cartoon character with different articles of clothing depending on weather conditions. Then it might say "Remember to bring your umbrella today, it's raining!"

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Quick start:

1. Clone this github repository on your local machine with HTTPS:// or SSH (SSH is provided below, use HTTPS if preferred)

   Note: You will need to keep the index.html file from the dist/ folder. This is currently not generated by Webpack and was manually made instead. 

   ```$ git clone git@github.com:yh63935/weather-it-rains.git```

3. Install all necessary dependencies

   ```$ npm install```

4. To view the site, you will also need a development server because of the API security restrictions. I used Node.js live-server, but you can use any other development server you are comfortable with. See how to install and use Node.js live-server here (https://gist.github.com/donmccurdy/20fb112949324c92c5e8). Then open up the app using the live-server and view the app!
