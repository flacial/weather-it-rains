<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Description
This is a weather app that shows the next 3 day forecast of the location you search, and the hourly forecast for each day (for the current day it shows the next hour to 11PM). It also changes background image depending on what the weather conditions (ie sunny) are. It's also responsive, so feel free to view the site on your other mobile devices/tablets.

[See live website hosted on Github Pages](https://yh63935.github.io/weather-app/) 

### Motivation
As a next step in my coding journey, I learned about APIs, promises, async, and await. As someone, who frequently checks the weather before going out or making plans, it seemed like a natural step to create this app. Although I know creating a weather app is fairly typical of coders to make, what sets this apart, is that this weather app **IS NOT based on a tutorial**. I spent a lot of time thinking about how to approach pulling data from the API, organizing it, and of course the best way to structure and organize the code.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Quick start:

1. Clone this github repository on your local machine with HTTPS:// or SSH (SSH is provided below, use HTTPS if preferred)

   Note: You will need to keep the index.html file from the dist/ folder. This is currently not generated by Webpack and was manually made instead. 

   ```$ git clone git@github.com:yh63935/cafe-page-webpack.git```

3. Install all necessary dependencies

   ```$ npm install```

4. Build dist/ files on your local machine

   ```$ npm start```

5. Open up index.html on your local to view your own copy

6. Alternatively go to [https://yh63935.github.io/cafe-page-webpack/](https://yh63935.github.io/cafe-page-webpack/) to see a live demo hosted on Github Pages.
